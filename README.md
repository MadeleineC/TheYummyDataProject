<h2>Project Description:</h2> 
We are a local data analysis group specialized in the food industry.
Clients provide us with three basic details about their desired restaurant:
- type of cuisine
- anticipated average order value (price)
- target markets they are considering (city & states).
We then provide data to clients to help them decide where they should expand or open a new restaurant.

<h2>Research Questions:</h2>

To answer the following research questions, we are utilizing the scenario that our client wants to open a cheap ($ on Google) taco restaurant and that she is considering neighborhoods in Austin, Texas.

<h3>What is the distribution of restaurants of a given type of cuisine by zip? What is the distribution of restaurants with similar price range by zip? </h3>

Utilizing the below heatmap we see that Downtown Austin (78702) has by far the highest density of taco restaurants, followed by a distant second and third of 78704 (Barton Hills/South Congress/South Lamar) and 78757 (North Shoal Creek/Crestview).
